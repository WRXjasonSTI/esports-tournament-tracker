## Description and Features
Select Difficulty is a mobile-friendly website tailored to both avid eSports fans as well as beginner fans who are open to being introduced to the world of competitive video gaming. Beginners can come to learn about the nuances of different games, watch gaming personalities, and be immersed in the competitive nature of major tournaments. This is done with the integration of the Twitch and PandaScore APIs.

The Twitch API allows users to see which broadcasters are live an any given time based on the game they select. The PandaScore API allows us to relay ongoing tournament information for the selected game.
